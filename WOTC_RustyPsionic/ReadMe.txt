[h1]What is This?[/h1]
This my personal adaptation of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1138411890] ADVENT AVENGERS Psionics Class [/url]
If AA wishes for me to remove this I will.

For those not familiar with the above class mod, this mod introduces a Custom Class based around psionic skills that ranks up and grows like any other normal soldier.

[h1]So what did I change?[/h1][list]
[*]Well, for starters it is [i]optional[/i] in the config on if you want to trash the old psi lab. The default is to trash it.
If you re-enable the lab, you may also want to re-enable the Psi-Operative class by adjusting the XComClassData.
This is so you have the option to use a dedicated Psionic alongside something like [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2134513735] Kyuubicles Psi Overhaul v3 [/url]
[*] This class integrates the perks from [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1662114279] Iridars More Psi [/url]. No class data edits needed.
[*] Works with most mod added psionic weapons including;[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2224463798] Psi Implants [/url], [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1549781357] PZ Psi Melee [/url], [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1144417938] Ashlynne_Lee's ADVENT Warlock Rifle [/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1505294997] Armoured Psi Vipers Vorpal Gatling Guns [/url]
[*] Works with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2222545926] Psionics Ex Machina 3.0 [/url]
[*] Has pistol slot config for [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1705464884] Dedicated Pistol Slot [/url]
[*] Uses a recolour of [b]NelVlesis[/b]' updated GTS image, and I made a new GTS Perk Icon
[*] GTS Perk updated to give a boost only when concealment is broken. Boost is configureable. GTS Unlock costs are configureable.
[*] Full localisation pass for class description, encyclopedia entry, nicknames and rank names
[*] Inclusion of photobooth option to count this class as a Psionic Operative for poses
[/list]
No changes to the main 'Psionics' tech are done here, units will start with a Psi Amp (or Implant Amp) and you will still need to do the research to unlock better amps.

Internal name of the class is [i]RustyPsionic[/i]

Please see the base game and perk packs for descriptions of the abilites.
Limited XCOM AWC Pool. Can have bonds, can go on covert ops. Stat increases include Hidden Potential.

GTS Perk: Sixth Sense :: Grants a +20dodge bonus on concealment breaking action and a 1charge/mission conceal.

The [i]Soul Mend[/i] and [i]Panacea[/i] perks are technically cloned from [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1561030099] Mitzrutis Perk Pack [/url] but I had them made before finding them in the MPP and kinda mashed both versions together.
The AWC Pool contains perks from [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2115077818] Bstars Perks [/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2042813766] Stormriders [/url], these are optional extras.

[h1]Useful Info:[/h1]
[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1128263618] Detailed Soldier Lists [/url] will display the Psi offense stat when used with this class
[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1458945379] Extended Personal Info [/url] also lets you see the PSI stat in the Soldier List.
[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1281427768] UI Mod for Def/Mob/Psi [/url] allows you to see the PSI stat in the Armoury UI, but not elsewhere.
[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1122974240] Robojumpers Squad Select UI [/url] Only shows the Psi Stat on Squad Select after the main 'Psionics' research is done

[h1]Known Issues/Compatibility[/h1][olist]
[*]I've used this setup for my AA Psionics for about the last 6months and found it rather well balanced. Technically its an all new class so will add to the game just like any other class. In this respect you could run this AND AA Psionics if you really wanted.
[*]I use some config tweaks for [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1662114279] Iridars More Psi [/url], not shared here, but I don't think they affect the class balance all that much.
No other known issues, but hundreds of mods in 'the wider world', so something might crop up.
